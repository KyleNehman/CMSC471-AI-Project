AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 680.18 692.30 <o,f0,male> so in this particular situation it's {UH} a(2) {NOISE} scan {NOISE} of a living person {BREATH} i have(2) this pen <sil> and(2) i <sil> look at the {UH} data(2) {UH} and(2) i <sil> move the pen towards the(2) head {BREATH} and(2) all of a sudden i feel {COUGH} resistance <sil> so i can(2) feel the skin <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-680.18-692.30-F0_M-S100)

AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 707.10 717.73 <o,f0,male> so this is really nice {NOISE} and(2) {NOISE} to take that even further this is a {NOISE} heart {BREATH} and(2) this is also {UM} due to these fantastic new(2) scanners that just in {BREATH} zero point three seconds(2) i can(2) scan the whole heart <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-707.10-717.73-F0_M-S100)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 718.01 730.39 <o,f0,male> and(2) i can(2) do that with time resolution {BREATH} so just looking at this heart <sil> i can play back a video here {BREATH} and(2) this is {SMACK} karljohan one of my graduate(3) students who 's(3) been(2) working on this project and he(2) 's(3) sitting there in front of the haptic {SMACK} device the force feedback system {BREATH} <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-718.01-730.39-F0_M-S100)

AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 743.28 751.57 <o,f0,male> from the real living patient {SMACK} then he can(2) examine how the heart is moving {COUGH} he can(2) {NOISE} go inside <sil> push inside of the heart {BREATH} and really(2) feel how the valves are(2) moving <sil> <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-743.28-751.57-F0_M-S100)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 758.74 766.09 <o,f0,male> go inside of the patient 's(2) {NOISE} heart {NOISE} before you actually(2) do surgery {SMACK} and do that with high quality resolution data <sil> so this is really neat <sil> <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-758.74-766.09-F0_M-S100)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 768.18 776.87 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} we're going(2) {UH} even {NOISE} further into science fiction {UM} and(2) <sil> we heard a little bit about functional {NOISE} mri {BREATH} now {UH} this is {NOISE} really(2) an(2) interesting project(2) {UH} (AndersYnnerman_2010X-768.18-776.87-F0_M-S121)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 778.51 786.76 <o,f0,male> is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan {NOISE} the brain {BREATH} or any part of the body {UH} so what(2) we're(3) really(2) getting out of this <sil> is <sil> information(2) <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-778.51-786.76-F0_M-S121)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 786.98 799.69 <o,f0,male> the structure of the brain but we can {NOISE} also measure <sil> the difference {BREATH} in magnetic properties of blood {BREATH} that's <sil> oxygenated {SMACK} and(2) blood that's depleted of oxygen(2) {BREATH} that means that it's possible to map <sil> out {UH} the(2) activity(2) of the brain <sil> <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-786.98-799.69-F0_M-S100)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 79.92 88.60 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} taken the liberty <sil> just(2) for clarity to translate that {SMACK} to data(2) slices {BREATH} that {NOISE} would correspond to about fifty {NOISE} mb of {NOISE} data(2) {BREATH} which is small {UH} (AndersYnnerman_2010X-79.92-88.60-F0_M-S3)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 800.42 812.38 <o,f0,male> so this is something that we've been(2) {NOISE} working on(2) and(2) you just saw motts {UH} the research engineer there going(2) into the(2) {UH} mri system {BREATH} and(2) {UM} he was wearing goggles <sil> so he could actually(4) see things <sil> in the goggles so i could present things to him <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-800.42-812.38-F0_M-S100)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 813.26 819.96 <o,f0,male> in the scanner {COUGH} and this is a little bit freaky {BREATH} because what(2) motts is seeing <sil> is actually(4) this <sil> he(2) {SMACK} 's seeing his(2) own brain <sil> <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-813.26-819.96-F0_M-S100)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 821.03 830.67 <o,f0,male> <sil> so motts is doing something here and(2) probably(2) he(2) is going(2) like this {NOISE} with(2) his right hand because the <sil> left side is {BREATH} activated {UM} on(2) the motor cortex <sil> and(2) then he(2) can(2) see that {UM} at the same time {BREATH} (AndersYnnerman_2010X-821.03-830.67-F0_M-S100)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 831.20 838.41 <o,f0,male> these visualizations are brand new(2) {UM} and(2) this is something that we've been(3) researching for(2) a <sil> little while(2) {BREATH} this is another sequence {NOISE} of motts {NOISE} brain <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-831.20-838.41-F0_M-S100)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 838.63 848.73 <o,f0,male> and(2) <sil> here we asked motts {NOISE} to calculate backwards from one hundred so he(2) 's(3) going(2) one hundred {SMACK} ninety seven {BREATH} ninety four and(2) then he(2) 's(3) going(2) backwards {BREATH} and you can(2) see how the little math processor is working up here in his(2) brain <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-838.63-848.73-F0_M-S100)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 849.23 858.47 <o,f0,male> and {NOISE} is {UM} lighting up the whole brain {NOISE} well this is fantastic we can(2) <sil> do this in real time {BREATH} we can(2) investigate things we can(2) tell him to do things you can(2) also see that his(2) visual cortex is activated(2) in the back of the head {BREATH} <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-849.23-858.47-F0_M-S100)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 871.34 882.17 <o,f0,male> and(2) in just a second here you will see {NOISE} okay here motts {NOISE} now move your left foot {SMACK} so {NOISE} he(2) {NOISE} 's going(2) {NOISE} like this {BREATH} for twenty(2) seconds(2) he 's(3) going(2) like that and all of a sudden it lights up up here {BREATH} so we've got motor cortex activation up <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-871.34-882.17-F0_M-S100)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 883.26 888.91 <o,f0,male> so this is really really nice {UM} and(2) {UH} i think this is a great tool and(2) connecting also <sil> with(2) the previous talk here <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-883.26-888.91-F0_M-S100)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 889.27 899.42 <o,f0,male> {NOISE} this is something that we could use(2) as a tool {NOISE} to {NOISE} really understand how the neurons are working how the brain is working {BREATH} and(2) we can(2) do this with(2) very very high visual quality {BREATH} and(2) very fast resolution {SMACK} <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-889.27-899.42-F0_M-S100)
AndersYnnerman_2010X 1 AndersYnnerman_2010X 89.26 98.03 <o,f0,male> you think about the data(2) {UH} we can(2) handle today just(2) on {UM} normal {BREATH} mobile devices {BREATH} if you translate that {SMACK} to(3) <sil> phone books {NOISE} it's about one meter of phone books in the {UM} <sil> (AndersYnnerman_2010X-89.26-98.03-F0_M-S3)
