Ted Talk Text Classification
============================

### Currently:
Unsupervised alg that tokenizes input and calculates tf.idf across the corpus. 
Clustering is implemented via hierarchical agglomerative clustering with the group average link method.

### If we switch to supervised algs:
Most likely using [keras](https://github.com/raghakot/keras-text)
* [Relevant keras classification](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/intro-to-text-classification-with-keras-automatically-tagging-stack-overflow-posts)
